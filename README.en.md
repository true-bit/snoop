                        in other modes, the maximum limit of weak PCs is used. Too low

                        [--version/-V] option. This option is recommended for use
                        1) if the user has a multi-core device 2) does not want to use
                        the Quick mode [--quick/-q] 3) intends to speed up the search,
                        for example, in the mode with the [--found-print/-f'] option.
                        The option is personal and can accelerate the search in
                        Snoopfull version to enormous speeds
  --quick, -q           Fast and aggressive search mode. 
                        Does not reprocess failed resources,
                        which speeds up the search,
                        but also slightly increases Bad_raw.
                        Quick mode adapts to PC power,
                        does not print intermediate results,
                        is effective and is designed for Snoop full version
```

**Example**
```
# To search for only one user:
$ python3 snoop.py username1 #Running from source
$ snoop_cli.bin username1 #Running from release linux
# Or, for example, Cyrillic is supported:
$ python3 snoop.py –æ–ª–µ—Å—è #Running from source
# To search for a name containing a space:
$ snoop_cli.bin "bob dylan" #Running from release linux
$ snoop_cli.bin dob_dylan #Running from release linux
$ snoop_cli.bin bob-dylan #Running from release linux

# Running on Windows OS:
$ python snoop.py username1 #Running from source
$ snoop_cli.exe username1 #Running from release win
# To search for one or more users:
$ snoop_cli.exe username1 username2 username3 username4 #Running from release win

# Search for a lot of users;
# avoiding freezes on websites (more often the "dead zone" depends on the user's ip address);
# print only found accounts; save pages of found accounts locally; 
# specify a file with a list of wanted accounts; 
# connect to the expandable and updated web-base Snoop for search:
$ snoop_cli.bin -t 6 -f -S -u ~/file.txt -w #Running from release linux

# check the Snoop database:
$ snoop_cli.bin --list all #Running from release linux

# print the help for Snoop functions:
$ snoop_cli.bin --help #Running from release linux

# Searching for two usernames on two resources:
$ snoop_cli.bin -s habr -s lichess chikamaria irina

# Get Snoop full version:
$ snoop_cli.bin --donate

# Enable Snoop plugins:
$ snoop_cli.bin --module #Running from release linux
```
+ 'ctrl-c' ‚Äî abort search.  
+ The found accounts will be stored in `~/snoop/results/nicknames/*{txt|csv|html}`.  
+ Open csv in office in, field separator **comma**.  
+ Destroy **all** search results ‚Äî delete the '~/snoop/results' directory.  
or incl. and reset cache `snoop_cli.exe --autoclean #Running from release OS Windows`.

# Update Snoop to test new features in the software

| ========= |=======================================================| ======= |

Solving:
1. Reconfigure your Firewall *(for example, Kaspersky blocks resources for adults).*

2. Check the speed of your Internet connection:  
`python3 snoop.py -v username`  
If any of the network parameters are highlighted in red, Snoop may hang during the search.  
At low speed, increase the 'x' value of the '--time-out x' option:  
`python3 snoop.py -t 15 username`.  

3. In fact, this is not a mistake. Fix username  
*(for example, some sites do not allow Cyrillic characters; "spaces" or "Vietnamese-Chinese encoding"
in user names, in order to save time: - requests are filtered).*

4. **Change your IP address**  
–°ensorship are the most common reasons why the user receives skip errors/false positives/and in some cases '**Alas**'.  
When using Snoop from the IP address of the mobile operator's provider, the speed **may** drop significantly, depending on the provider.  
For example, the most effective way to solve the problem is **TO USE A VPN**, Tor is not very well suited for this task.  
Rule: one scan from one ip is not enough to get the most out of Snoop.

5. Open in the Snoop repository on Github-e Issue/Pull request  
*(inform the developer about this).*

6. Do not pay attention, sites sometimes go for repair work and return to operation.

7. There is [problem](https://wiki.debian.org/ContinuousIntegration/TriagingTips/openssl-1.1.1 "the problem is simple and solvable") with openssl in some GNU/Linux distributions, and also the problem with sites that haven't been updated in years. These problems occur if the user intentionally started snoop with the '--cert-on' option.  
Solving:
```
$ sudo nano /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf

# Edit the lines at the very bottom of the file:
[MinProtocol = TLSv1.2]
on
[MinProtocol = TLSv1]

[CipherString = DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=2]
on
[CipherString = DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=1]
```
