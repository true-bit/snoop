**Self-build software from source**  
**Native Installation**  

Install [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/ "Termux with F-Droid, GP Termux is no longer updated!")  
```
# NOTE_1!: if the user has errors with $ 'pkg update', for example due to country censorship,
# and/or due to the fact that Termux has not been updated for a long time on the user's device,
# then removing/installing Termux application will not help,
# since after deletion, old repositories remain on the user's device, the solution is:
$ termux-change-repo
# and choose to get updates (for all repo) from another mirror repository.

# Enter Termux home folder (i.e. just open Termux)
$ termux-setup-storage
$ pwd #/data/data/com.termux/files/home # default/home directory

# Install python3 and dependencies
$ apt update && pkg upgrade && pkg install python libcrypt libxml2 libxslt git
$ pip install --upgrade pip

# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/snooppr/snoop

# Enter the Snoop working directory  
$ cd ~/snoop  
# Install the 'requirements_android.txt' dependencies  
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements_android.txt  


# Optional↓
# To expand the terminal output in Termux (by default, 2k lines are displayed in the CLI),  
# for example, displaying the entire database of the option '--list-all [1/2]'  
# add the line 'terminal-transcript-rows=10000' to the file '~/.termux/termux.properties'  
# (the feature is available in Termux v0.114+).  
# Restart Termux.  

# The user can also launch the Snoop Project on the snoop command from anywhere in  
# the cli by creating an alias.  
$ cd && echo "alias snoop='cd && cd snoop && python snoop.py'" >> .bashrc && bash  

# The user can also run a quick check on the database of the site he is interested in,  
# without using the 'list-all' option, using the 'snoopcheck'command  
$ cd && echo "alias snoopcheck='cd && cd snoop && echo 2 | python snoop.py --list-all | grep -i'" >> .bashrc && bash  
# restart Termux.  
# At the end of the search work snoop on the request to select "with which to open the search results" select the default / system HTMLviewer.  

# NOTE_2!: to auto-open search results in an external web-browser:  
$ cd && pkg install termux-tools; echo 'allow-external-apps=true' >>.termux/termux.properties  
```
NOTE_3!: if the Android user has a flawed (that is, 12+) and breaks Termux, read the instructions for solving the problem [here](https://github.com/agnostic-apollo/Android-Docs/blob/master/en/docs/apps/processes/phantom-cached-and-empty-processes.md#how-to-disable-the-phantom-processes-killing).  
NOTE_4!: old patched python versions 3.7-3.10 from are supported [termux_tur repo](https://github.com/termux-user-repository/tur/tree/master/tur).

                        in other modes, the maximum limit of weak PCs is used. Too low
                        or too high a value can significantly slow down the software.
                        ~For the calculated optimal value for this device, see the
                        'snoop info' block, the 'Recommended pool' parameter, the
                        [--version/-V] option. This option is recommended for use
                        1) if the user has a multi-core device 2) does not want to use
                        the Quick mode [--quick/-q] 3) intends to speed up the search,
                        for example, in the mode with the [--found-print/-f'] option.
                        The option is personal and can accelerate the search in
                        Snoopfull version to enormous speeds
  --quick, -q           Fast and aggressive search mode. 
                        Does not reprocess failed resources,
                        which speeds up the search,
                        but also slightly increases Bad_raw.
                        Quick mode adapts to PC power,
                        does not print intermediate results,
                        is effective and is designed for Snoop full version
```

**Example**
```
# To search for just one user:
$ python3 snoop.py username1
# Or, for example, Cyrillic is supported:
$ python3 snoop.py олеся
# To search for a name containing a space:
$ python3 snoop.py "bob dylan"
$ python3 snoop.py bob_dylan
$ python3 snoop.py bob-dylan

# To search for one or more users:
$ python3 snoop.py username1 username2 username3 username4

# Search for multiple users - sorting the output of results by country;
# avoid long freezes on sites (more often the 'dead zone' depends on your ip-address);
# print only found accounts; save pages found
# of accounts locally; specify a file with a list of wanted accounts;
# connect to search for Snoop's extensible and updatable web-base:
$ python3 snoop.py -c -t 9 -f -S -u ~/file.txt -w

# Search for two usernames on two resources:
$ python snoop.py -s habr -s lichess chikamaria irina

# Get Snoop full version:
$ python snoop.py --donate

# 'ctrl-c' — abort search
```
Found accounts will be stored in '/storage/emulated/0/snoop/results/nicknames/*{txt|csv|html}'.  
csv open in *office, field separator **comma**.    

Destroy **all** search results - delete the directory '~/snoop/results'.
or ```python snoop.py --autoclean```

```
# Update Snoop to test new software features:
$ python3 snoop.py --update #requires a Git installation.
```
